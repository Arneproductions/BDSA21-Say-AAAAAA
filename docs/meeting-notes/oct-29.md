# October 29th
## Since last time

	- Created webhooks for discord
	- Added issue and PR templates
- Albert:
	- Added license

## Challenges


## Today
- Adrian is creating a Google Drive folder to share group files.
- Meeting with TA

### Questions for TA
- What license are we supposed to use / where is it?

### Questions for Paolo
- Are moderators a different type of user?
- Where in the lifetime of content does the moderator live?
- What is the processes of moderating content, should there be an approval process?
- Does the site only allow access to students?
- Who creates content, is it specific content creators or general users?
- What does "semi automated" mean
	- What is the actual functional requirement of this. Downloading content from and external link or dowloading resources, or something entirely different?
	- Related: Does the site have it's own content or is the entire site links to different web resources, and therefore just a nicely structured repository of external resources.
- When you say "It would be helpful if it were easy to create local copies of the repository." do you mean "It would be helpful if it were easy to create local copies of **sections** of the repository."
- Specifically what is meant with "respository"

## Until next time
- Each member of the team write a scenario
